- üñºÔ∏è Advanced image recognition for UI navigation
- ‚è∞ Scheduled execution for precise timing
- üîÑ Automatic updates and maintenance
- üìä Comprehensive logging system for debugging and analysis

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have:

- Windows 10 or later
- PowerShell 5.1 or later
- Stable internet connection
- 100GB+ free disk space
- [miHoYo Launcher](https://launcher.mihoyo.com/) installed at `C:\Program Files\miHoYo Launcher`

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/shuakami/zzz-uid-script.git
   cd zzz-uid-script
   ```

2. **Install Python**
   Run as Administrator:
   ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
    Y
   .\JS\InstallPython311.ps1
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment (Optional for Scheduled Execution)**
   For automatic execution on July 4th at 7 AM:
   ```powershell
   .\JS\SetLive.ps1
   ```
   
4. [Configuration](#Configuration)

## Configuration

1. Edit `config.py`:
   ```python
   # OpenAI API Configuration
   OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_openai_api_key"
   OPENAI_API_URL = "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"

   # Logging Configuration
   LOG_FILE = "auto_uid_grabber.log"
   LOG_LEVEL = "INFO"
   ```

2. **Important**: Before running, enter your account credentials in `/password/default.txt`:
   ```
   account,password
   ```

## Usage

### Automatic Execution
If `SetLive.ps1` was run, the script will execute automatically on July 4th at 7 AM.

### Manual Execution
To run manually:
1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
2. Navigate to the script directory
3. Execute:
   ```powershell
   python start_ocr.py
   ```

## Logging

The script generates several log files for monitoring and troubleshooting:

- `game-main.log`: Core UID reservation component logs
- `game_login.log`: Logs from `start_ocr.py`
- `login.log`: Authentication process logs
- `install.log`: Installation process logs

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the relevant log files in the script directory.
2. Ensure all prerequisites are met.
3. Verify your internet connection.
4. Confirm your OpenAI API key is correctly set in `config.py`.

Common issues:
- **Script fails to start**: Run PowerShell as Administrator.
- **Image recognition issues**: Verify screenshots in the `dist` folder match your launcher's appearance.
- **API errors**: Check your OpenAI API key and internet connection.

## FAQ

Q: Is this script compatible with macOS or Linux?
A: Currently, it's designed for Windows only due to miHoYo Launcher integration.

Q: Is using my OpenAI API key in the script safe?
A: Yes, but never share your `config.py` or API key. The script uses the key locally on your machine.

Q: Does this script guarantee a UID?
A: While it automates the process, success isn't guaranteed due to server limitations and high demand.

Q: Can I modify the execution schedule?
A: Yes, by editing `SetLive.ps1`. Ensure compliance with official guidelines regarding the UID reservation process.
